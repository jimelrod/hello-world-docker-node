# Sample node app for testing

Just a basic express server. Oh, there's also a default `Dockerfile` for node. 

### Initial Setup
`npm install`

### To run
`node server [port number]` - default port is `8080`

## Valid endpoints
GET <http://localhost:8080> - Raw text saying "Hello, world!" or something like that.

GET <http://localhost:8080/api> - json response with some stuff in it or something.
